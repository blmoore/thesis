\section{Hi-C data}\label{methods:hic}

\subsection{Mapping}\label{methods:mapping}

Raw Hi-C reads were downloaded from published datasets (Table \ref{hictable}) through
the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO)\citep{Barrett2013} or the Short Read Archive (SRA)\citep{Leinonen2011a} with identifiers:
GSE35156 (H1 hESC), GSE18199 (K562) and SRX030113 (GM12878). These
paired reads were mapped independently to a reference genome: hg19/GRCh37 for human data, and mm10/GRCm38 for mouse.

Mapping was performed using the \texttt{hiclib} software
package\citep{Imakaev2012} and \texttt{bowtie2}\citep{Langmead2012} with
the \texttt{-{}-very-sensitive} flag. An iterative mapping approach was used to maximise the number of aligning fragments.\cite{Imakaev2012} Each fragment end was aligned first using short terminal sub-sequences. Those unmapped or with ambiguous mapping were then taken forward into the next iteration and extended until the entire fragment end had been aligned. Those remaining pairs with one or more unmapped ends were discarded.

\subsection{Filtering}\label{methods:filtering}

After mapping, interactions are first aggregated into restriction fragments then by regular binning of various resolutions (particularly 40 kb, 100 kb and 1 Mb). Several filters were applied at this stage, with the following cases removed:\cite{Imakaev2012} 
\begin{itemize}
\item Reads directly adjacent to a restriction enzyme site (within 5 bp)
\item Identical read pairs (presumed PCR duplicates)
\item Very large restriction fragments ($>100$ kb) which are likely from a repetitive or poorly-assembled region
\item Extremely over-represented fragments (top $.05\%$) which may throw-off eigenvector derivation
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Correction}\label{methods:correction}

Iterative correction and eigenvector expansion (ICE) is an approach to normalisation and processing Hi-C data, implemented as software library written in \texttt{python}.\citep{Imakaev2012} The iterative correction algorithm performs matrix balancing with the aim of generating a doubly stochastic matrix from raw interaction counts. That is, such that symmetric matrix $\mathbf{A}$ has both row and columns of equal sum. In practice, this effectively enforces "equal visibility" of each fragment, correcting for previously-described biases in interaction recovery such as GC-content and fragment length\cite{Yaffe2011} but without explicitly modelling these latent variables. This procedure is thus converting actual interaction counts into normalised interaction frequencies (IF), and to relative rather than absolute quantities. Scaling of IFs permits comparison of Hi-C experiments with very different sequencing depths (as is the case in this work, see Table \ref{hictable}). Despite differences in the levels of sequencing, otherwise the experiment methods underlying the produced Hi-C data were similar: the HindIII restriction enzyme was used in each case and the Hi-C protocol was largely unchanged (that is, we did not consider data from Hi-C variants such as TCC\cite{Kalhor2012} and \emph{in-situ} Hi-C\cite{Rao2014}).

\subsection{Eigenvector calculation}\label{sec:eigs}
Additional functionality provided by ICE is the eigenvector expansion of normalised contact maps. Eigenvectors from observed/expected matrices were chosen for consistency with Lieberman Aiden \emph{et al.},\cite{Lieberman2009} as opposed to the related eigenvectors calculated in Imakaev \emph{et al.}\cite{Imakaev2012} from the corrected maps alone. The details of this procedure are described in section \ref{sec:compartments}. Briefly, observed contacts (O) are divided by an expected matrix (E) which is generated by averaging the super- and sub-diagonals of the O matrix. That is, the E matrix gives the expected value of interactions at a given distance.

Importantly, the first two principle components (PCs) were calculated, and that with the highest absolute Spearman correlation with GC content is taken to reflect A/B compartmentalisation. PC eigenvectors were then orientated to positively correlate with GC, ensuring positive values reflected A compartments and negative values B compartments. Another subtlety is the calculation of eigenvectors per chromosome arm as opposed to per chromosome, this prevents issues with some meta- and submetacentric chromosomes where the first principle component indicated chromosome arms.\cite{Lieberman2009, Imakaev2012} Eigenvector expansion was performed on both 1 Mb and 100 kb matrices, below these resolutions results became less stable, and it has been shown that eigenvectors at

\section{ENCODE features}\label{methods:encode}

Genome-wide ChIP-seq datasets for: 22 DNA binding proteins and 10
histone marks were made available by the ENCODE
consortium\citep{Dunham2012, Boyle2014} along with DNase I
hypersensitivity and H2A.z occupancy, for each of the Tier 1 ENCODE cell
lines used in this work: H1 hESC, K562 and GM12878. These data were
pre-processed using MACSv2\citep{Zhang2008} to produce fold-change
relative to input chromatin. GC content was also calculated and used in
the featureset to give 35 total inputs (Table \ref{tab:features}).

\subsection{Clustering input features}

To quantify collinearity of input features, correlation matrices built from genome-wide vectors of input feature measures were build and hierarchicaly clustered. The "significance" of observed clustering was assessed using sub- and super-sampled bootstrapping, with stable clusters deemed significant, as implemented in the \texttt{pvclust} R package.\cite{Suzuki2006a}

\section{Modelling}\label{modelling}

\subsection{Random Forest}\label{sec:rf}

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=4.5in]{figs/randforests.pdf}
\captionsetup{width=\textwidth}
\caption[Random Forests overview.]{ {\bf Random Forests overview. } 
 Random Forests are an ensemble of bagged, de-correlated classification or regression trees first described by Breiman.\cite{Breiman2001a}
}\label{fig:randforests}
\end{center}
\end{figure} 

Random Forest (RF) regression,\cite{Breiman2001a}  was used
as implemented in the R package \texttt{randomForest}.\cite{Liaw2002}
The RF algorithm (Fig. \ref{fig:randforests}) makes use of a collective of regression trees (size $ntrees$), each built from a
bootstrapped sample of the training set. In growing each tree, a small
number of variables ($mtry$) is tested at each bifurcation node, and that which minimises the
variance in child node subsets is selected at a specific
threshold. Having trained a group of trees, these can then be used as
predictive tools by inputting a vector of features to each tree and
averaging the output leaf node value across the forest. RF regression
was used as it is known to be one of the most powerful regression
methods developed to date,\cite{Svetnik2003, Cutler2007} typically
providing low bias and low variance predictions without the need for
variable selection.\cite{Diaz2006, Dasgupta2012}

Additionally the RF method represents an example of ``algorithmic
modelling''\cite{Breiman2001b} in that it makes no assumptions about the
underlying data model.
Parameters of $mtry = \frac{n}{3}$ (where $n$ is the number of input features) and $ntrees =
200$ were assumed as they are known to be
largely insensitive;\cite{Dasgupta2012, Hastie2001} this was verified
with the dataset used in this work (Fig. \ref{fig:rfparam}). 

\begin{figure}
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=5in]{figs/rfparams.pdf}
\captionsetup{width=\textwidth}
\caption[Random Forest parameters are largely insensitive.]{ {\bf Random Forest parameters are largely insensitive. } 
Two user-facing Random Forest paramters are known to be insensitive over a broad range.\cite{Hastie2001} Optimisations for $ntrees$ (the number of trees in the forests) and $mtry$ (the number of features tested at each node) are shown for three different models, with typical values of 200 trees and $\frac{1}{3}$ of input variables highlighted.
}\label{fig:rfparam}
\end{center}
\end{figure} 

Variable importance within Random Forest regression models was measured
using mean decrease in accuracy in the out-of-bag (OOB) sample. This
represents the average difference (over the forest) between the accuracy
of a tree with permuted and unpermuted versions of a given variable (Fig. \ref{fig:randforests}), in
units of mean squared error (MSE).\citep{Cutler2007, Dasgupta2012}

\subsection{Model performance}\label{sec:modelperf}

The effectiveness of the modelling approach was measured by four
different metrics. Prediction accuracy was assessed by the Pearson
correlation coefficient between the OOB predictions and observed eigenvectors, and the root mean-squared
error (RMSE) of the same data. Classification error, when predictions
where thresholded into $A \geq 0; B < 0$, was also calculated using
accuracy (\% correct classifications or True Positives) and area under
the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve. Together these give
a comprehensive overview of the model performance, both in terms of
regression accuracy of the continuous eigenvector, and in how that same
model could be used to label discrete chromatin compartments.

For cross-application of cell type specific models, a single Random
Forest regression model was learned from all 1 Mb bins for a given cell
type. This was then used to predict all bins from each of the other two
cell types.

To test the sensitivity of the models to resolution, we also applied cell-type specific models learnt at 1 Mb resolution to input features binned at 100 kb. 

\subsection{Other modelling approaches}
 
Linear regression was used as a baseline for comparison with more complicated approaches such as Random Forest. If the same modelling accuracy could be achieved with simple multiple linear regression, this would be a faster and more interpretable modelling framework.

Partial least squares (PLS) regression was also used to model compartment profiles. PLS regression is well-suited to highly correlated inputs, employing a dimensionality reduction step to help address this redundancy, yet lacks the interpretability of a multiple linear regression. Similar to RF, PLS regression is aimed at building highly-predictive models rather than understanding singular relationships between a predictor and independent variable.\cite{Tobias1995} The \texttt{plsdepot} R implementation of PLS regression was used in this work.

%\subsection{Graphical lasso}
%Regularised models made use of the Graphical LASSO\cite{Friedman2008}
%(least absolute shrinkage and selection operator) as a method of
%$L_1$-norm based
%regularisation, implemented via the \texttt{glasso} R package. The
%graphical lasso provides tuneable regularisation which is
%capable of feature selection via minimising regression parameters to
%0. It was chosen in this case due to the multicollinearity of the
%featureset, the algorithm's fast speed of
%execution and the intuitiveness a graphical model
%presents.\cite{Friedman2008} 
%
%More specifically, the graphical lasso regulates the number of 0s in
%the inverse covariance matrix, $\bm{\Theta}=\bm{\Sigma}^{-1}$, also known as the
%precision matrix. Then if element $\theta_{ij}=0$, the variables $X_i$ and $X_j$ can be said to be
%conditionally independent, given the remaining
%variables.\cite{Mazumder2012} The algorithm minimises a negative
%log-likelihood (Eqn. \ref{eq:glasso}\cite{Mazumder2012}) given the tuning parameter $\lambda$, which was tuned
%in this case to leave a small number of variables ($<10$)
%directly dependent on the eigenvector data. \\
%\begin{equation} \label{eq:glasso}
%\underset{\bm{\Theta}\prec\bm{0}}{\mathrm{minimise}}~f(\bm{\Theta}) :=
%-\log\det(\bm{\Theta}) + \mathrm{tr}(\bm{\mathrm{S}\Theta}) + \lambda
%\lVert\bm{\Theta}\rVert_1
%\end{equation}

\section{Variable regions}\label{variable-regions}

\subsection{Stratification by
variability}\label{sec:variable}

Median absolute deviation (MAD) was chosen as a robust measure of the
variability in a given 1 Mb block between the three primary cell types
used in this work: H1, K562 and GM12878. Blocks were ranked by this
measure and split into thirds that represented ``low'' variability (the
third of blocks with the lowest MAD), ``mid'' and ``high'' variability.
Each subgroup was then independently modelled using the
previously-described Random Forest approach.

``Flipped'' regions are those whose compartment state differs in one
cell type relative to the other two. For example, if a 1 Mb bin was
classified as ``open'' in H1 hESC and ``closed'' in both K562 and
GM12878, this is said to be a ``flipped'' compartment (to open).

\subsection{Enhancer enrichment}\label{enhancer-enrichment}
%explanation of combined states: http://rohsdb.cmb.usc.edu/GBshape/cgi-bin/hgTables?db=hg19&hgta_group=regulation&hgta_track=wgEncodeAwgSegmentation&hgta_table=wgEncodeAwgSegmentationCombinedGm12878&hgta_doSchema=describe+table+schema

Chromatin state annotations used in this work were retrieved from the ChromHMM\cite{Ernst2011} and SegWay\cite{Hoffman2012} combined annotations.\cite{Hoffman2013} These represent the consensus from two independent chromatin state prediction algorithms, and ignore regions of apparent disagreement; hence in theory making more robust and conservative predictions than either algorithm independently. Nevertheless, Hoffman \emph{et al.} caution that in areas of disagreement, each algorithm may highlight differing biological phenomena so should also be considered separately.\cite{Hoffman2013}

The set of state predictions from the combined algorithms are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Predicted transcription start sites (TSS)
\item Promoter flanking regions
\item Transcribed reigons
\item Repressed regions
\item Predicted enhancers
\item Predicted weak enhancer or \emph{cis} regulatory element
\item CTCF-enriched elements
\end{enumerate}

Short, discrete state predictions such as enhancers were
considered ``shared'' if there was an overlapping enhancer annotation in
either of the two other cell types, and labelled as ``tissue-specific''
otherwise. This was repeated for each of the called chromatin states.

\subsection{Gene ontology analysis}

Variable regions (section \ref{sec:variable}) were tested for functional enrichments using Gene Ontology (GO) annotations.\cite{Ashburner2000} The DAVID tool\cite{Huang2008} was used to compare GO terms for genes located in variable compartments with a background set of genes within all annotated compartments.


\section{Boundaries}\label{boundaries}

\subsection{TADs}\label{tads}

TAD boundaries were called using the software provided in
\citet{Dixon2012} using their recommended parameters. For the generation
of boundary profiles, input features were
averaged into 40 kb bins spanning $\pm450$ kb from the boundary bin.

To test for the enrichment or depletion of a chromatin feature over a
given boundary, a two tailed Mann-Whitney test was used to compare the
boundary bin with the ten outermost bins of the window (5 from either
side). The significance level at $\alpha = 0.01$ was then
Bonferonni-adjusted for multiple testing correction, and results with
\emph{p}-values exceeding this threshold were deemed significantly
enriched or depleted at a given boundary.

To compare boundaries between cells, each TAD boundary called in K562 and GM12878 were compared with those called in H1 hESC. For each boundary, the minimum absolute difference to the nearest matching boundary in H1 hESC was recorded, and this was then compared with a null model of an equal number of boundaries randomly-placed along available bins. A Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was then used to compare the empirical cumulative distributions of these distances.

\subsection{Compartments}\label{sec:compartments}

Eigenvectors were calculated as described in section \ref{sec:eigs}. A/B compartmentalisation has previously been called simply from the properly-orientated principle component eigenvector, with positive values representing a bin in an A compartment state, and negative values representing a bin in a B, more repressive state.\cite{Lieberman2009} 

Compartment boundaries were called by first training a two-state hidden
Markov model (HMM) on the compartment eigenvector and then using the
Viterbi algorithm to predict the most likely state sequence that
produced the observed values. The point at which transitions occurred
between states was taken as a boundary which was then extended $\pm 1.5$
Mb to give a 3 Mb window in which a boundary was though to occur.

Boundary enrichments and alignments were tested in the same manner as TADs, described in section \ref{tads}.

\subsection{MetaTADs}\label{sec:metatad}

MetaTADs are a concept discovered by collaborators. Their method for calling such features involve the constrained hierarchical cluttering of neighbouring TADs with the greatest inter-TAD contacts. This results in a tree of increasing metaTAD aggregation. For boundary analysis of metaTADs, again a similar approach was used to that of TADs (section \ref{tads}) but thresholded to within a given range of sizes. MetaTADs below 10 Mb were excluded, as to have no lower bound results in $\frac{2}{3}$ of all TAD boundaries likewise considered MetaTAD boundaries, reducing the power to analyse any differences. 10 Mb was chosen in an attempt to compromise minimising the overlap between TAD and metaTAD boundaries, while also retaining a large enough sample size. An upper bound of 40 Mb was also chosen, as beyond this threshold inter-TAD contacts were found to be no higher than expected by chance. In practice, the tree-like structure means any upper-bound has little impact as a filter: in almost all cases, any boundary in a metaTAD of size $> 40$ Mb will also form metaTADs below this value. Additionally, the hierarchical nature of metaTADs means that some boundaries are present at multiple levels of the tree. Only one case of each boundary position was tested for feature enrichments.

\section{Giemsa band comparison}\label{giemsa-band-comparison}

Cytogenic band data and Giemsa stain results were downloaded from the
UCSC genome browser (table \texttt{cytoBandIdeo}). The genomic
co-ordinates are an approximation of cytogenic band data inferred from a
large number of FISH experiments.\citep{Furey2003}

To compare G-band boundaries with our compartment data, we allowed for a
$\pm 500$ kb inaccuracy in G-band boundary. For each G-band boundary,
the minimum absolute distance to any compartment or TAD boundary was
calculated for each cell type. To generate a null model, \ldots

\section{Nuclear positioning}
Previously published data  on chromosome positioning preference within
the nucleus was used to label each chromosome as ``inner'', ``middle''
or ``outer''.\cite{Boyle2001} Chromosomes whose DAPI hybridisation
signals were significantly enriched ($p\leq 2\times10^{-2}$) in the inner nuclear shell, as
defined by Boyle \emph{et al.}\cite{Boyle2001}, made up the ``inner''
group and included chromosomes 1 and 16. Similarly the ``outer'' group
had enriched signals ($p\leq 5\times10^{-3}$) in the outer shell relative to the inner nuclear
shell and included chromosomes 2, 3, 11-13 and 18. The remaining
chromosomes in our filtered dataset, 6, 14 and 15, were assigned to
the ``middle'' group and showed no significant to either inner or
outer nuclear shells ($p \geq 0.1$).\cite{Boyle2001} The significance
of the difference in distribution of eigenvectors in the inner
versus outer shell was determined by a one-sided Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S)
test, with the alternative hypothesis that the empirical cumulative
density function of the inner chromosome eigenvectors $F_{inner}$
is greater-than or equal-to $F_{outer}$. This chromosomal positioning data was measured in lymphoblastoid
cells though nuclear architecture is though to be largely conserved
between cell types\cite{Chambers2013, DeWit2013} and even higher primates.\cite{Tanabe2002}

\section{4C analysis}\label{methods:4c}

The experimental protocol used by our collaborators to generate 3C-seq data (also known as 4C) recommends the \texttt{r3Cseq} R package,\cite{Stadhouders2013, Thongjuea2013} part of the bioconductor repository\cite{Gentleman2004, Huber2015} for the R programming environment.\cite{Ihaka1996}

This package functions both to produces normalised interaction frequencies which are comparable between experiments, and to assign statistical significance to any identified contacts, thereby reporting regions that co-localise to a greater degree than expected by their genomic proximity alone.

\subsection{Normalisation}\label{methods:4cnorm}

The normalisation procedure is adapted from a previous method for normalising deepCAGE data between samples.\cite{Balwierz2009} In short, the reverse-cumulative distribution of read counts per restriction fragment is fit to a power-law model; this effectively encodes the \emph{a priori} expectation of exponential decay of the number of contacts as distance increases from the viewpoint. Transformed read counts per million (RPM) can then be retrieved from a standardised reverse cumulative distribution, parametrised with the empirical coefficient, $\alpha = -1.35$.\cite{Thongjuea2013}

This normalisation procedure has the effect of making the output RPM value independent of the original experiment's sequencing depth and, more importantly, acts to reduces the impact of artefacts and errors by enforcing the expected power-law relationship of restriction fragment read counts.

\subsection{Significance estimation}\label{methods:4csignif}

The \texttt{r3Cseq} package\cite{Thongjuea2013} also attempts to assign a measure of significance to observed contact frequencies. This is done through a simple method of background estimation based on observed values. The justification for this non-independent estimate of background signal is that a relatively small proportion of observed contacts are expected to be significantly enriched, thus won't unduly perturb an average signal.\cite{Thongjuea2013} An improved method that avoids this assumption has since been developed where a background model was iteratively fitted, with outlier removal at each revision.\cite{Ay2014}

Here a non-parametric cubic smooth spline is fit to normalised read count data using a heuristic smoothing parameter. This model then provides an expected level of interaction at a given distance from the viewpoint in \emph{cis}. From this, it is simple to calculate a $Z$--score as:

\begin{equation}\label{form:r3cseq}
Z = \frac{(O-E)}{\sigma}
\end{equation}

\noindent Where $\sigma$ is the standard deviation of residuals from the observed ($O$), expected ($E$) difference. This $Z$-score can then be converted to a $p$-value which in turn is corrected for multiple testing using bootstrapped estimates of false-discovery rate (FDR) $q$-values\cite{Storey2004} (as implemented in the \texttt{qvalue} R package\cite{qvalue}). This $Z$--test approach assumes a normally-distributed test statistic, an assumption that typically does not hold on 4C data where interactions distal to the viewpoint are increasingly sparse, however this approach and variants thereof have been applied in a variety 4C and 5C analyses (e.g. \cite{Simonis2006, Sanyal2012, Splinter2012, Gao2013, Dixon2015, Crane2015}).

While we are mostly concerned with these \emph{cis} interactions, \texttt{r3Cseq} also offers significance testing for \emph{trans} interactions between the viewpoint and restriction fragments on different chromosomes. Here instead of distance scaling, the expected ($E$) terms in eqn. \ref{form:r3cseq} are genome-wide averages excluding regions $\pm$ 100 kb around the viewpoint.\cite{Thongjuea2013} This means the absolute values of normalised RPMs reported for \emph{trans} interactions are in practice upscaled, being equivalent to experimental RPMs less the most deeply-sequenced regions, i.e. the viewpoint and immediately adjacent regions.

\subsection{3--D modelling}\label{methods:3dmodelling}

\section{5C analysis}\label{methods:5c}

\section{Scripts and other analyses}

Much of this work has been performed by writing custom scripts in the R programming language.\cite{Ihaka1996} Code for the majority of analyses described in this thesis are available through a public git repository hosted on \texttt{github} at \href{https://github.com/blmoore/3dgenome}{github.com/blmoore/3dgenome} (instructions on how to reproduce analyses and figures are included therein). A special mention goes to the packages of Hadley Wickham which are used throughout, especially \texttt{ggplot2}\cite{ggplot2} and \texttt{dplyr}\cite{dplyr}.

The programming language python\cite{rossum1995} was also employed to a lesser-extent, as were command--line tools such as \texttt{bedtools}\cite{Quinlan2010} and \texttt{SAMtools}\cite{Li2009}. Additionally command-line \texttt{BigWig*} tools\cite{Kent2010} were used, as well as the UCSC genome browser associated data tracks.\cite{Kent2002, Raney2014, Kuhn2013a}.
